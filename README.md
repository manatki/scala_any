# Scala Any
Self-description of [scala_any community](https://scala_any.t.me)

### Disclaimer
This is an initial draft of Scala Any telegram community. This document is WIP, may contain a lot of personal bias, bad grammar and other kinds of awfulness. Please fill free to raise any question or suggestion via issue or PR

## Purpose
We are multi-language, multi-subject scala telegram discussion group. We experiment to use topics, to gather as much telegram sub-communities into one, so anyone can discover something new without wandering for link to the correct subgroup.

### Speaking Languages
We don't restrict using any language, currently wide-used languages for communication (in the reverse alphabetical order):
- Ukrainian
- Russian
- English

You can start discussion in any language and not be restricted or asked to use other. If you see any messages the language you can't comprehend, feel free to use online translation services and respond with your own native language. Yes, that sounds wild, but as been said, we are experimental community.

### Rules 
There aren't currently well-defined rules or CoC yet. But generally you better be

- Respectful
- On topic


There are several topics, and their corresponding admins, and in general it's admin power and responsibility to make sure that the discussion is benign. So whenever you are unsure, feel free discuss corresponding topic rules in the Meta topic.
Current list of topics:
